    PARAMETER MAP - PLEASE READ BEFORE EDITING

    This file contains all the parameters for RRAuto.
    This file also contains all Lift encoder values for cone retrieval from the stack.

    If making a new auto, include "AutoParams params = new AutoParams();" within the class.

    All headings are converted to radians here, so there is no need to convert them in the main autonomous programs.

    All values are based on BlueTerminalAuto and are negated as needed in RedTerminalAuto
